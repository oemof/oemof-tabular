def remap(mapping, renamings, selection):
    """Change `mapping`'s keys according to the `selection` in `renamings`.

    The `renaming` found under `selection` in `renamings` is used to rename the
    keys found in `mapping`. I.e., return a copy of `mapping` with every `key`
    of `mapping` that is also found in `renaming` replaced with
    `renaming[key]`.

    If key doesn't have a renaming, it's returned as is. If `selection` doesn't
    appear as a key in `renamings`, `mapping` is returned unchanged.

    Example
    -------
    >>> renamings = {'R1': {'zero': 'nada'}, 'R2': {'foo': 'bar'}}
    >>> mapping = {'zero': 0, 'foo': 'foobar'}
    >>> remap(mapping, renamings, 'R1') == {'nada': 0, 'foo': 'foobar'}
    True
    >>> remap(mapping, renamings, 'R2') == {'zero': 0, 'bar': 'foobar'}
    True

    As a special case, if `selection` is a `class`, not only `selection` is
    considered to select a renaming, but the classes in `selection`'s `mro` are
    considered too. The first class in `selection`'s `mro` which is also found
    to be a key in `renamings` is used to determine which renaming to use. The
    search starts at `selection`.


    Parameters
    ----------
    mapping: `Mapping`
        The `Mapping` whose keys should be renamed.
    renamings: `Mapping` of `Mappings <collections.abc.Mapping>`
    selection: `Hashable`
        Key specifying which entry in `renamings` is used to determine the new
        keys in the copy of `mapping`. If `selection` is a `class`, the first
        entry of `selection`'s `mro` which is found in `renamings` is used to
        determine the new keys.
